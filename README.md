# Team Builder
Inazuma Eleven Team Builder

With this application you can form your own Inazuma Eleven teams.

## Functionality
Currently you can choose from all Inazuma Eleven 1, 2 and 3 players, including scout characters.
GO (and maybe Ares/Orion) characters will be added later.
You can also add custom players. (Perfectly square images look the best)

Before adding team members you can change the player names to English or Japanese names.
You can also choose a formation, an emblem and a coach.

When your team is complete you can export the team as an image and share it online!

## Upcoming features
My goal is to add these features in the future:
* Decrease loading times
* Laptop/tablet Responsiveness
* GO players & coaches
* A more lively design
* More formations
* Remember players when changing formation

And these features might get added in the future:
* Ares / Orion players & coaches
* When changing language of player names also change the names of the already selected players
* Draggable player boxes
* Change way to add players
