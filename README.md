# Inazuma Eleven Team Builder
With this application you can form your own Inazuma Eleven teams. Choose from over a 1000 Inazuma players and create your own dream team!

## V2 news
[Version 2](https://github.com/MikeEbbe/team-builder/releases/tag/v2) of the Team Builder has been released!
* GO1 players have been added (at last).
* Responsiveness for phones has been added.
* I have temporarily disabled the scout players in order to decrease loading times and lag. There were over 1000 scout players (over half of all Inazuma players), which caused the loading times to increase quite a lot. Therefore I have temporarily disabled them and in the meantime will be looking too fix the issue.

## Functionality
Currently you can choose from all Inazuma Eleven 1, 2, 3 and GO players.
Chrono Stones and Galaxy (and maybe Ares/Orion) characters will be added in a later version.
Scout players have been temporarily disabled.
You can also add custom players. (Perfectly square images look the best)

Before adding team members you can change the player names to English or Japanese names.
You can also choose a formation, an emblem and a coach.

When your team is complete you can export the team as an image and share it online!

## Upcoming features
My goal is to add these features in the future:
* Decrease loading times
* Laptop/tablet Responsiveness
* GO2/3 players
* GO coaches
* A more lively design
* More formations
* Remember players when changing formation

And these features might get added in the future:
* Ares / Orion players & coaches
* When changing language of player names also change the names of the already selected players
* Draggable player boxes
* Change way to add players
