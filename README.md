Inazuma Eleven Team Builder

With this application you can form your own team consisting of Inazuma Eleven players.

## Functionality
Currently you can choose from all Inazuma Eleven 1, 2 and 3 players, including scout characters.
GO (and maybe Ares/Orion) characters will be added soon.
You can also add custom players. (Perfectly square images look the best)

Before adding team members you can change the player names to English or Japanese names.
You can also choose a formation, an emblem and a coach.

When your team is complete you can export the team as an image and share it online.

## Upcoming features
* Right now the website only works well on pc and laptop screens. Mobile support will be added in the future.
* Draggable player boxes
* A more lively design
* GO players & coaches and maybe Ares/Orion
